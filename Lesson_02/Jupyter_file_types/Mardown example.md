# Markdown files

You can write a markdown file in JupyterLab and preview it in its rendered form. You can write them live and then print to PDF.

## What are markdown files used for?

Well, if you wanted to quickly write a formatted document and then print it to PDF. That is one useful way of using markdown files in JupyterLab. 

## That's neat but what else?

Funny you should ask. Since we are engineers, we like math. Writing math can be done in JupyterLab markdown files by using $\LaTeX$

_Don't believe me? Here is an example:_

$$
a = 4\\
b = 5\\
c = a + b\\
d = 3 + a
$$

Or, how about this?

$$
S_x = \frac{b h^2}{6}\\
M_r = \phi S_x f_y
$$

## But, what's $\LaTeX$? I think I heard about that in uni...

$\LaTeX$ is _another_ programming language that is purpose built for laying out documents, specifically mathematics in documents. It is relatively simple to learn but it is beyond the scope of this course to teach it. 

I bring it up because if you already know some $\LaTeX$, you can just use it right away in either a Markdown _cell_ in a Jupyter notebook or you can use it in Markdown _documents_ that you can preview and print to PDF in JupyterLab.

If you _don't_ know $\LaTeX$, it can be easy to learn the basics, especially if you are just using it to write some equations in JupyterLab.
